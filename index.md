Welcome to my personal space where curiosity meets code.

This blog is a reflection of my journey through the evolving world of Artificial Intelligence—featuring hands-on learnings, deep dives into GenAI, LLMs, RAG architectures, and the latest trends shaping the future of intelligent systems. Whether it's building production-grade models, experimenting with new tools, or unpacking complex concepts, I share insights, tutorials, and real-world applications from my experience as an AI engineer.

Beyond the tech, you'll also find a personal page where I share milestones, thoughts, and moments that shape who I am—because behind every algorithm is a human story.

If you're passionate about AI, eager to learn, or just curious about the mind behind the machine, you're in the right place.
